I've added SPEC.md to this project — it's a detailed build spec for a Hound Around Resort website (dog daycare/boarding/grooming in Cottage Grove, MN). This is a real client project that needs to go to production.

Before writing any code, I need you to:

1. Read SPEC.md thoroughly, then read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
2. Review the existing project structure — this was initialized from sanity-template-nextjs-clean. Understand what the template gives us out of the box vs what we need to build
3. Check the design reference screenshots in the design/ folder — these are the Figma exports for each homepage section. Use them to verify layout details as you build
4. Review frontend/package.json to understand our current dependencies (Next.js 16, React 19, Sanity v5, Tailwind v4)

Then create a detailed implementation plan:

- Audit what the template already provides (schemas, components, config) vs what we need to add/modify
- Create a phased checklist with clear done/not-done status for every task
- Flag any conflicts between the spec and the existing template setup (especially Tailwind v4 config, Sanity schema structure, and the page builder pattern)
- Note anywhere the spec needs adjustment based on what you see in the actual codebase
- Identify the critical path to a production-ready homepage

Do NOT start building yet — just the plan. Take your time reviewing everything first.
